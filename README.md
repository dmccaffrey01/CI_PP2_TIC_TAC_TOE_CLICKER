The colour scheme is a minimal gray and blue to help the user focus on the game and not have the background stand out. I choose the colour scheme and tested the contrast using WebAIM.

Source-Sans-Pro was used for the navigation bar including the logo with sans-serif as a fallback.
Lato was used for the body with sans-serif as a fallback.

All the pages mostly had the same issues

#### Errors

There was 3 errors in all the pages. All had to do with empty links in footer of page, because I used icons instead of text this flagged an error.

#### Alerts

The alerts are high on all pages but most of them are to do with links which I had to use CSS tricks to get around, some of them are possible heading alerts aswell

### Performance

## Bugs 

### Clicker Game glitch
During the game as the player clicks and kills the monster, if the player is clicking to fast the monster and the timing game starts the game can glitch out and breaks the timing game then the monster changes every second.
I tried to fix this by adding a monster spawn delay and also adding an isMonsterDead variable to help block the clicks as the monster dies but still sometimes the game can still glitch.
