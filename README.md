## Design

### Design Selection
The website was designed to have a feeling of minimalistic and new to match the unique game

### Colour
The colour scheme is a minimal gray and blue to help the user focus on the game and not have the background stand out. I choose the colour scheme and tested the contrast using WebAIM.

Source-Sans-Pro was used for the navigation bar including the logo with sans-serif as a fallback.
Lato was used for the body with sans-serif as a fallback.
